# Risk-Based Lane Change Maneuver for Intelligent Vehicle

## Abstract
Traffic risk quantifies human sense or prediction of potentially dangerous, which often refers to an accident or collision in traffic. Any behavior that forces other drivers to change their current intention can be interpreted as the source of traffic risk. Human drivers often make their driving decisions based on the risk they perceive or predict. In this undergraduate research report, a risk calculation model, a driver reaction model, and a motion prediction model are proposed to describe the risk-based driving decision in a two-dimension traffic environment. We use the pygame package to visualize three lane-change scenarios. Based on our study, we propose a two-dimensional risk to define the sense of potential traffic danger for future advanced driving technique.
